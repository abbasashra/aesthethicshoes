    <h3>Sporting Essentials to Help You Train Like a Pro</h3>
    <p>
        Choose your men’s shoes with care, taking into consideration the return you want to see from your activity, whether for a day on the golf course, a training session for the next football season, a running plan for a marathon, or hiking in the mountains. The adidas range of shoes for men is designed using state-of-the-art technology and innovative features that will suit your exercise style.

        Football boots exist to play on soft ground with agility stud configuration, or hard ground with lightweight, firm ground outsoles. Golfers can choose shoes with a Primeknit upper that molds itself to your foot or a pair with a leather upper that keeps your feet warm and dry on cold, wet golf days. Challenge your personal best with a pair of adidas running shoes for men made with advanced Boost technology in the midsole that gives you extra lift with every step. Hikers, pick up a pair of lightweight GORE-TEX® shoes to keep your feet dry on rainy days.
